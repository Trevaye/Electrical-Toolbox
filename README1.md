# Overview

The Electrical Toolbox is a web application designed to help users calculate the required wire length for various electrical installations. This tool enhances learning in web development by implementing dynamic UI updates, user-friendly interactions, and accurate mathematical calculations for different wiring scenarios.

To start the app, simply open the indexupdate.html file in any web browser. This will load the main page where users can input installation parameters and receive instant calculations.

The purpose of this software is to refine front-end development skills, explore JavaScript for calculations, and plan for future backend integration to store and manage component data.

Web Pages

Main Page (indexupdate.html): The central page where users can enter distance, height (if applicable), and additional wire length for adjustments. The result is dynamically displayed upon calculation.

# Dynamic Elements:

The height input field appears only when relevant.

Calculations update in real-time without requiring a page refresh.

# Development Environment

* Tools Used:

* Visual Studio Code

* Live Server extension for quick testing

# Programming Languages & Libraries:

* HTML for structure

* CSS for styling

# Useful Websites

* MDN Web Docs

* W3Schools

* Stack Overflow

# Future Work

* Implement backend support for saving user inputs and historical calculations.

* Add more complex calculations for various electrical components.

* Improve UI/UX with better styling and animations.

* Enhance mobile responsiveness for better usability on smaller screens.
